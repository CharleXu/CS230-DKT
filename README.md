# CS230-DKT
Final Project

## Research Problem Summary
Knowledge tracing is the task of modeling a student's knowledge acquisition and loss process based on the student's past trajectories of interactions with a learning system. Many existing works developed statistical knowledge tracing models based on psychological insights. However, due to the limitations of parameter size and the form of distributions they can choose from, these models are usually incapable of handling large data. With the advent of deep learning, researchers have proposed RNN-based knowledge tracing models, e.g., Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). Current DKT models achieved superior performances than the traditional methods in many domains such as mathematics, language, and science. Many variants of Chris Piech's deep knowledge tracing models have also been proposed in recent years. 

In this project, we would like to continue on Chrisâ€™ work. Our approach is to incorporate the latest developments in machine learning techniques, such as LSTM (bidirectional), as well as embedding. In addition, we would also include richer features in addition to skill sequence itself. We hope to achieve better performance.
